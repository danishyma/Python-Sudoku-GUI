# Python-Sudoku-GUI

The Sudoku solver was cereated using recursive algorithm with backtracking inspired on the lecture from MIT open course Programming for the Puzzled https://ocw.mit.edu;
And the Sudoku GUI in my take of the code inspired on Tech Tim's https://bit.ly/2Ul0O57 bersion and was coded using pygame library.

Added features and changes to Sudoku GUI:
- randomized boards
- menu buttons
  - clear guesses
  - pause timer
  - start new board
- confirmation on exit
- keyboard movement selection
- different code organization structure
- implications to reduce backtracking
